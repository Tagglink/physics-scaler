# physics-scaler
An electron app I made just for the excitement of making an electron app.

As a part of a university course we were supposed to create a somewhat realistic physics simulation of a planetary body orbiting another planetary body. Because I liked the idea of simulating the actual earth and sun, I wrote a C++ program to scale the mass, gravity and time scales freely, so that you can find a scaling that suits the bad precision of floating-point numbers.

So what better way than to use Electron as the front-end? None! Except it took a while to get it working!
