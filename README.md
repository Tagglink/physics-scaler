An electron app I made just for the excitement of making an electron app.

As a part of a university course we're supposed to simulate a planetary body orbiting
another planetary body. I wrote a C++ program to scale the values freely so they become 
usable with single floating-point numbers, and figured I'd share it with my other students.

So what better way than to use Electron as the front-end? None! Except it took a while to get it working!
